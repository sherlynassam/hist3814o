<hr>
<p>In today’s exercises, we get to explore databases. I cannot personally participate in the Commonwealth War Grave Commission to find war dead. My last name, <strong>Assam</strong> did not reach any results. Neither did my mother’s maiden name, <strong>Awasom</strong>.</p>
<p>However, my boyfriend has a military background in his family. His last name, <strong>Gardner</strong>, reached 1107 records! After asking him for additional details, he informed me that it was his mother’s side, <strong>Howard</strong>, with the veteran - her father, William, served.</p>

<p>William Howard had 198 records to his name, so I downloaded them, and searched for a match with his wife’s name, Magret Howard, to no avail. Upon questioning country of service and year of death, I realized that Howard did not serve in the Second World War, though he was capable. He served later, in the Alberta Reconnaissance Regiment, and died at age 86 in 2005. However, it was interesting to explore the lives of those who sacrificed during the world wars.</p>

However, searching Jerusalem showed me 7 hits within their <a href="http://edh-www.adw.uni-heidelberg.de/foto/suche?fo_modern=Jerusalem">photographic database search</a></p>
