Scotland was the place of his nativity ; he remembers having seen King William III and was present at the two succeed ing coronations. Neither his memory nor his fight are in the least impaired ; and such is his profession he regularly walks on Sunday to Philadelphia and back. His third wife is now living and is not more than thirty years old.,
