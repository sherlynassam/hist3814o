Scotland was the place of his nativity; he remembers having seen King William III. and was present at the two succeeding coronations. Neither his memory nor his sight are in the least impaired; and such is his strength that after working all the week at his profession he regularly walks on Sunday to Philadelphia and back. His third wife is now living nd is not more than thirty years old.,longevity;humour
