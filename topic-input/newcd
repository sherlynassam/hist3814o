ID57,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,12,07,inform,Extract of a letter from a Gentleman at Charles Town South Carolina September 2 1789 to a friend in Bristol.My inclination has taken such a stubborn longing after your side of the water that I cannot enjoy tranquility here. So very wretched have I been at times that I can hardly support the regret I feel that I ever changed the bright and alluring varieties of cultivation England for the dreary the desolate scenes of America.Happy are those who have quitted this land of misery ; and I belive a situation here is not found enviable by the greatest patriots in the State. They are all in the secret sighing for the comforts of Old England. A bare pittance there would be preferable to the largest possessions here.,settlement description;society
