 ID1,Caledonian Mercury,Edinburgh,Scotland,United Kingdom,1811,08,26,inform,Commerce of Canada.Extract of a letter. The population of Canada in 1760 was reckoned at 62000 souls whilst her exports had never exceeded two millions of livres tournois (about 90000l) The imports must have greatly exceeded the exports ; but not even a conjecture of the differences can be formed. The present population of the Canadas may be rated at 320000 souls ; but great as this augmentation may appear commerce will be found to have greatly surpassed the proportional ratio of the population.From 1763 to 1793 the exports may have varied from 120000l. to 300000l. chiefly of wheat furs and peltry. But during the last 18 years they have increased to the surprising sum of 1220963l. 10s. Sterling as we shall presently perceive by the following estimate which cannot be much over or under the truth :-Furs and skims ... 105000 0 Wheat all other grain flour and biscuit 136500 0 Lumber of all descriptions ... 536500 0 Pot and pearl ashes ... 223000 0 Beets and pork 30000 0 Sundries (too tedious to particularise) ... 16000 10 The hulls masts and yards of 28 vessels built in the province ... 84000 0 Total of domestic produce 1131000 0 Sundry goods imported and exported 4780 0 1125780 0Commissions and additional charges at 7 1/2 per cent. Sterling ... 65183 0 t. 1220963 10The amounts of imports of dutiable articles at Quebec is about 380000l. Sterling. It is impossible to ascertain the value of goods not dutiable ; but we may safely conlude that they will make the total of importans one million Sterling leaving a balance in favour of these provinces which but a few years ago would have appeared incredible. This property is carried by 661 vessels whose tonnage is 143893 navigated by 6758 seamen. The freight and primage on these vessels are nine guineas per ton being 1359788l. 17s. Sterling which without taking into consideration the charges in Britain will make the gross amount of our cargoes landed exceed 3000000l. Sterling being about a tenth of the imports of the United Kingdom.Our commerce has become considerable with the United States. A few years ago our imports from thence greatly exceeded our exports. But since respectable and intelligent American merchants have begun to settle amongst us I believe the scale turned in our favour ; and thus British industry is commencing to run in a channel never before much thought of.,
