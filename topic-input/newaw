ID22,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,10,09,inform,Philadelphia Aug. 5.We are happy in informing our readers that in the memory of the oldest man among us a more plentiful year has not been known than the present. Neither mildew nor fly has affected the wheat; the grain is heavy and full and in large quantities. The other grains are likewise plentiful and of an excellent quality. Such distinguished favours call for the gratitude of the inhabitants of the United Sates to the great Author of Nature; especially when these blessings of nature are connected in the same year with deliverance from anarchy and with the establishment of a wise free and just government.,agriculture
