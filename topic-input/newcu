ID75,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,19,entertain,CURIOUS ADVERTISEMENT From the PITTSBURGH GAZETTEPittsburgh Dec. 23 1789. JULY the twenty-seventh day My wife Betsey ran away From bed and boardâ€“and this did say She would no longer with my stay. Since she has left me without cause I'll give her time enough to pause That she may see her grievous error When I live happy with a fairer. So I forewarn both great and small To trust her any thing at all For of her contracts from this day One farthing's worth I will not pay. DENNIS O'BRYAN.,humour;marriage
