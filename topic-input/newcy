St. Pierre Martinico Sept. 11This Colony is in a perfect state of anarchy ; is so much that we have had thoughts of quitting the island and going to Trinidad taking the negroes with us. Unless some speedy and effectual succours arrive the colony is utterly ruined. The greater part of the colonists this day assembled at Gros-morne.–The grenadiers who were in the fort of Trinity with twenty three officers of the regiment were glad to make their escape.– There are 1500 men in the FOrt Bourbon many of whom are from Dominica Guadaloupe and other colonies an supposed to have been sent by Martinico refugees.–The firing of cannon is heard incessantly ; at this rate the magazine of powder will soon be consumed.The Municipality of Fort Royal have been obliged to promise and sign whatever the insurgents have been please to dictate.–The soldiers run about the streets and oblige the inhabitants to give them money.–Imagine in short a scene of confusion and terror and you will then have some idea of the persent [?] of Fort Bourbon and Fort Royal.The town of St. Pierre swarms with strangers who come here from all parts. M. Chabrol Colonel of the regiment which has been sent here together with a company of Chaffeurs has been appointed comandant o the NAtional troops.The women confident that it is in his power to re-establish tranquility prostrate themselves before him strew the ground on which he walks with flowers and affectionately embrace him.– He seems willing to comply with their wishes.The Colonial Assembly sits at Gros-morne guarded by an army of 4000 men under the command of M. Dumoise appointed by the General.We are assured that the insurgents are arming four privateers with which they mean to attack Trinity. Some soldiers attempted to penetrate among them but were repulsed by the Mulattoes.,slave rebellion
