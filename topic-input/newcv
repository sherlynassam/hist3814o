ID76,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1790,11,22,inform,On Tuesday afternoon the six Cherokee Chiefs visited the Cathedral of St. Paul's which they explain[?] with an equal degree of curiosity andamazement. They were asked whether they would not attend the evening service which they readily complied and seemed particularly delighted with the organ.The Cherokee Chiefs having made us an offer of 20000 men gratitude obliges us to make them some acknowledgement whether we accept their offer or not.–We can very well spare them the members of the Halter Club–all our housebreakers highwaymen pick pockets swindlers Faro and E O Table keepers–and all their accomplices to an amazing number.Such a collection would be a truly valuable present.–Among them are found dispersedly all the qualitities of able Generals–skilful Financiers –able Negotiators active Citizens–and men highly expert at a Coup de Main.Were we to add the Pugilistic tribe–the Cherokee Chiefs might on their return to their own country enter into a boxing war against their enemies–with a certainty of the most brilliant success.Trading Justices and Lawyers they would perhaps be glad to have ; and it is the opinion of most people that a few thousands of the latter description of men might be spared.,
