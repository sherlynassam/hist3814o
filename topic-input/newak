ID10,Glasgow Advertiser,Glasgow,Scotland,United Kingdom,1789,08,21,inform,Extract of a letter from India by the Dublin East Indiaman to Mr. William JonesWe left Patia Dec. 15 1789 and went to Decca and arrived there after a passage of 16 days. Just as we arrived there was a famine and it was really a shocking sight to behold; you could not move out of your house but the corpses lay in your way and the wild dogs and jackalls were eating them at noon-day. The Hindoos never bury their dead but burn them to ashes if they can afford it ; if not throw them into the river. I have lately seen a man brought to the river side and laid down at lowwater mark before he was dead ; and when the the tide flowed it carried him off. If a man woman or child dies at night the corpse is eaten by the morning. This I have been an eye witness of ; for as I always rode out on horseback every morning I had an opportunity of seeing more than those that did not. In the course of six months I became so much used to it that I took no notice of it.I was there when a dreadful conflagration took place and burnt upwards of seven miles without intermission and many souls perished. Now consider first an inudation; second a famine; and third a conflagration. How much the place must be distressed I leave you to think. I left Decca the 1st of December last and arrived at Calcutta after a passage through the Sunderburns (in 17 days) hearty and well thank God.,
