# **This Week**
Is about finding data - downloading, accessing, digitizing... I searched databases, dowloaded Wget, and more.

The Hard Part
---
- downloading the Canadian Archives, which is committed under my Wget trials
- 

Favourite Part
---
- the database search was so fun! Even though I didn't find who I was looking for, or the script I was seeking out, I found random, but interesting information in a like field. I couldn't find my boyfriend's grandpa's history, but I did find 198 other William Howards!
